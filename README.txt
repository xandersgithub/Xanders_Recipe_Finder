This is a recipe finder I made. Its pretty simple, there is a lot of room for improvement, namely tab switching once the web thing is open. this was designed on a linux laptop so it may not work on windows. 

in essence you simply enter what you have in your kitchen, spices and all, view your list and search or modify it

the program will then enter these into google and fetch you some recipes you can cook using what you have

great for cocktails, dinner, and snacks

You can use this for anything and everything. I didn't create anything special, just something useful so I have not included any licensing for this as there is really just no need for that

If you want to update this and make something cooler than it already is feel free to send it to me. 

Don't forget to install beautiful soup 4 and selenium to use this program.
